                <p>Since 2019 I was focused on building projects, it led me to start working as a freelancer.</p>
                <p>After making few apps which were a total disaster, I have started learning in public and sharing my
                  journey
                  on
                  different social platforms.
                </p>
                <p>It allowed me to join a startup in web3 industry and master more complex and commercial skills. When
                  I saw
                  how
                  professional, business focused software works, what are the difficulties and time consuming features
                  to
                  implement, I started to build <span className="font-bold text-[#32bbcf]">NotionFlow</span></p>
                <p>As more and more people are falling in love with Notion, I decided to launch it.</p>

            <p>
              When I was creating seperate web apps with Notion as a CMS, I realized that many things have to be set
              over
              and over again. Inspired to build systems, I knew that well built boilerplate can be a perfect, helpful
              product. Each developer is extremely happy, when he can save hours or days of debugging or configuring
              stack, so <span className="font-bold text-[#32bbcf]">NotionFlow</span> will:

                consuming
